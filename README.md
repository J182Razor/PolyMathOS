## 🧪 Scientific Foundation

PolyMathOS is built on rigorous scientific research from **Project 144** and the **Polymath Operating System** curriculum:

### Neuroscience Principles (Project 144 Research)
- **Reward Prediction Error (RPE)**: Dopamine as a teaching signal - positive RPE strengthens, negative RPE triggers attention
- **Hyper-Correction Effect**: High-confidence errors create maximum learning through massive negative RPE
- **Neuroplasticity Optimization**: High-intensity cognitive capture (HICC) protocol simulates critical period learning
- **Spaced Repetition Science**: Research-based intervals leveraging the forgetting curve and consolidation windows
- **State-Dependent Learning**: Alpha/Theta states optimize different learning activities
- **Dual Coding Theory**: Visual + verbal encoding for superior retention

### Learning Psychology
- **Meta-Learning**: Teaching users how to learn more effectively (Plan → Monitor → Evaluate)
- **Interleaving vs Blocking**: Mixing topics improves discrimination and long-term retention
- **Desirable Difficulties**: Making learning harder in the short term strengthens long-term mastery
- **Variable Ratio Schedules**: Unpredictable rewards maintain higher tonic dopamine than fixed rewards
- **Flow State**: Creating optimal conditions for deep learning experiences
- **Growth Mindset**: Fostering belief in the ability to improve through effort

### Research Sources
